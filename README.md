Repo contains my learning &amp; implementation for Vector Db.

## In brief of my understanding
A vector database is a specialized database designed to efficiently store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors, which are often representations of complex data such as images, text, and audio. These vectors are typically generated by machine learning models and are used for tasks like similarity search, recommendation systems, and data clustering.

## Key Components of a Vector Database Architecture:
### Vector Storage:
1. Data Ingestion: Vectors are ingested into the database through APIs or data pipelines. Each vector typically includes metadata for identification.
2. Storage Backend: The database uses a high-performance storage engine to manage the large volumes of vector data, often optimized for fast read/write operations.
### Indexing:
1. Index Construction: To facilitate fast similarity search, the vectors are indexed using specialized data structures like k-d trees, ball trees, or more advanced techniques like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms (e.g., HNSW, Faiss).
2. Index Maintenance: The index needs to be maintained and updated as new vectors are added, ensuring that search performance remains optimal.
### Similarity Search:
1. Query Processing: Users query the database with a target vector to find the most similar vectors in the dataset. This involves calculating distances (e.g., Euclidean, cosine similarity) between vectors.
2. Search Algorithms: Efficient search algorithms and heuristics are employed to quickly retrieve the nearest neighbors from the index.
### Scalability:
1. Distributed Architecture: Many vector databases are designed to scale horizontally, distributing data and queries across multiple nodes to handle large datasets and high query loads.
2. Load Balancing: Effective load balancing strategies ensure that no single node becomes a bottleneck, maintaining high availability and performance.
### Integration and APIs:
1. APIs and SDKs: Vector databases provide robust APIs and software development kits (SDKs) for easy integration with various applications and workflows.
2. Integration with Machine Learning Pipelines: They often integrate seamlessly with ML pipelines, allowing for real-time updates and retrieval of vector embeddings.
### Metadata Management:
Metadata Handling: In addition to vectors, these databases often manage metadata that describes the vectors, enabling more complex queries and filtering based on additional attributes.
### Example Architecture:
Here's a simplified architecture diagram for a vector database:
